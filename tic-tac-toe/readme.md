Click on link above to play the game.

Instructions:
- Player 1 is prompted to choose either X or O.
- Once the X or O button is clicked, player is alerted either "You chose X" or "You chose O", beginning the game.
- Players alternate placing X or O by clicking on empty spaces on the board.
- Players try to get three in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- The first player to achieve this will be alerted either "X is the winner" or "O is the winner."
- Should neither player achieve three in a row, a tie is called with an alert "It's a cat's game."
- To play again, click the reset button.

Approach taken and unsolved problems:
- Decided to let the player choose if they wanted X or O. This led me to needing a variable to define who's turn it is. The turn counter was a bit confusing at first, but using the modulus made it all come together. I decided to have the winning function search for text as the input. In retrospect, I may have done this differently. I think had a gone down another route, I could have been a bit more creative with my CSS. Figuring out the sizing for the buttons so that they look like a gameboard was a struggle. It looks correct on my screen, but I would like it to be responsive.
